'three little pigs' :
" Once upon a time there were three little pigs who went out into the world to seek their fortune and build their own houses.  the first little pig met a man carrying a bundle of straw. Please, sir, give me some straw to build me a house, he asked. The man gave him some straw, and the little pig built his house.  Then one day, along came a wolf who knocked loudly at the door <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/dreed47.alexa.skills/doorknock.mp3'/>  Little pig, little pig, let me come in, said the wolf.  And the little pig squealed:  No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!  Then the wolf replied:  Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!  So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the straw house in!  And the little pig escaped off into the forest!  The second little pig jogged along and met a man carrying a bundle of wood:  Please, sir, give me some wood to build me a house.  And the man gave him some wood, and the little pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, who knocked loudly at the door <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/dreed47.alexa.skills/doorknock.mp3'/>  Little pig, little pig, let me come in, said the wolf.  And the little pig squealed:  No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!  Then the wolf replied:  Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!  So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the wooden house in!  And the little pig escaped off into the forest!  The third little pig met a man carrying a load of bricks: Please, sir, give me those bricks to build me a house.  So the man gave him the bricks, and this pig built a fine house.  By and By, along came the wolf, and he knocked loudly at the door <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/dreed47.alexa.skills/doorknock.mp3'/> Little pig, little pig, let me come in, said the wolf.  And the little pig squealed:  No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!  Then the wolf replied:  Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!  Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, but he could NOT blow the brick house in! The wolf then decided to trick the little pig so he said:  Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnups.  Where, asked the little pig.  Oh, in Farmer Smith's field, and tomorrow morning we will go together and get some of these turnups for dinner.  Very well, said the little pig.  What time do you intend to set off?  Six o'clock is turnup picking time, replied the wolf.  But this little pig got up at five o'clock and gathered the turnups before the wolf came.  When the wolf arrived he called out:  Little pig. are you ready?  Ready, exclaimed the little pig,  I have been, and come back again, and got myself a nice pot ful for dinner, thank you.  The wolf was very angery he had been tricked!  He sprang on to the roof to get down the chimney.  But the pig had a large pot of boiling water on the fire and as the wolf came down he took off the lid and SPLASH!  In fell the wolf, and got burned very badly!  The wolf ran off into the forest never to be seen again!  And the third little pig lived happily ever after.  The end.",
