" Once upon a time there were three little pigs who went out into the world to seek their fortune and build their own houses.  the first little pig met a man carrying a bundle of straw. Please, sir, give me some straw to build me a house, he asked. The man gave him some straw, and the little pig built his house.  Then one day, along came a wolf who knocked loudly at the door <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/dreed47.alexa.skills/doorknock.mp3'/>  Little pig, little pig, let me come in, said the wolf.  And the little pig squealed:  No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!  Then the wolf replied:  Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!  So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the straw house in!  And the little pig escaped off into the forest!  The second little pig jogged along and met a man carrying a bundle of wood:  Please, sir, give me some wood to build me a house.  And the man gave him some wood, and the little pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, who knocked loudly at the door <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/dreed47.alexa.skills/doorknock.mp3'/>  Little pig, little pig, let me come in, said the wolf.  And the little pig squealed:  No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!  Then the wolf replied:  Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!  So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the wooden house in!  And the little pig escaped off into the forest!  The third little pig met a man carrying a load of bricks: Please, sir, give me those bricks to build me a house.  So the man gave him the bricks, and this pig built a fine house.  By and By, along came the wolf, and he knocked loudly at the door <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/dreed47.alexa.skills/doorknock.mp3'/> Little pig, little pig, let me come in, said the wolf.  And the little pig squealed:  No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!  Then the wolf replied:  Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!  Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, but he could NOT blow the brick house in! The wolf then decided to trick the little pig so he said:  Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnups.  Where, asked the little pig.  Oh, in Farmer Smith's field, and tomorrow morning we will go together and get some of these turnups for dinner.  Very well, said the little pig.  What time do you intend to set off?  Six o'clock is turnup picking time, replied the wolf.  But this little pig got up at five o'clock and gathered the turnups before the wolf came.  When the wolf arrived he called out:  Little pig. are you ready?  Ready, exclaimed the little pig,  I have been, and come back again, and got myself a nice pot ful for dinner, thank you.  The wolf was very angery he had been tricked!  He sprang on to the roof to get down the chimney.  But the pig had a large pot of boiling water on the fire and as the wolf came down he took off the lid and SPLASH!  In fell the wolf, and got burned very badly!  The wolf ran off into the forest never to be seen again!  And the third little pig lived happily ever after.",

"the 3 bears" :
"In a far-off country there was once a little girl who was called Silver-hair, because her curly hair shone brightly. She was a sad romp, and so restless that she could not be kept quiet at home, but must needs run out and away, without leave.   One day she started off into a wood to gather wild flowers, and into the fields to chase butterflies. She ran here and she ran there, and went so far, at last, that she found herself in a lonely place, where she saw a snug little house, in which three bears lived; but they were not then at home.   The door was ajar, and Silver-hair pushed it open and found the place to be quite empty, so she made up her mind to go in boldly, and look all about the place, little thinking what sort of people lived there.   Now the three bears had gone out to walk a little before this. They were the Big Bear, and the Middle-sized Bear, and the Little Bear; but they had left their porridge on the table to cool. So when Silver-hair came into the kitchen, she saw the three bowls of porridge. She tasted the largest bowl, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too cold; then she tasted the middle-sized bowl, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear, and found it too hot; then she tasted the smallest bowl, which belonged to the Little Bear, and it was just right, and she ate it all.   She went into the parlour, and there were three chairs. She tried the biggest chair, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too high; then she tried the middle-sized chair, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear, and she found it too broad; then she tried the little chair, which belonged to the Little Bear, and found it just right, but she sat in it so hard that she broke it.   Now Silver-hair was by this time very tired, and she went upstairs to the chamber, and there she found three beds. She tried the largest bed, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too soft; then she tried the middle-sized bed, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear, and she found it too hard; then she tried the smallest bed, which belonged to the Little Bear, and found it just right, so she lay down upon it, and fell fast asleep.   While Silver-hair was lying fast asleep, the three bears came home from their walk. They came into the kitchen, to get their porridge, but when the Big Bear went to his, he growled out:    SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TASTING MY PORRIDGE!    and the Middle-sized Bear looked into his bowl, and said:    Somebody Has Been Tasting My Porridge!    and the Little Bear piped:    Somebody has tasted my porridge and eaten it all up!    Then they went into the parlour, and the Big Bear growled:    SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!    and the Middle-sized Bear said:    Somebody Has Been Sitting In My Chair!    and the Little Bear piped:    Somebody has been sitting in my chair, and has broken it all to pieces!    So they went upstairs into the chamber, and the Big Bear growled:    SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TUMBLING MY BED!    and the Middle-sized Bear said:    Somebody Has Been Tumbling My Bed!    and the little Bear piped:    Somebody has been tumbling my bed, and here she is!    At that, Silver-hair woke in a fright, and jumped out of the window and ran away as fast as her legs could carry her, and never went near the Three Bears  snug little house again.",
