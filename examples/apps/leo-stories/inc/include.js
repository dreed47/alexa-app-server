They built their houses very quickly and then sang and danced all day because they were lazy. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.A big bad wolf saw the two little pigs while they danced and played and thought,   What juicy tender meals they will make! . He chased the two pigs and they ran and hid in their houses. The big bad wolf went to the first house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in minutes. The frightened little pig ran to the second pigs house that was made of sticks. The big bad wolf now came to this house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in hardly any time. Now, the two little pigs were terrified and ran to the third pigs house that was made of bricks.The big bad wolf tried to huff and puff and blow the house down, but he could not. He kept trying for hours but the house was very strong and the little pigs were safe inside. He tried to enter through the chimney but the third little pig boiled a big pot of water and kept it below the chimney. The wolf fell into it and died.The two little pigs now felt sorry for having been so lazy. They too built their houses with bricks and lived happily ever after. ",   
"the princess and the pea" : 
 "Once upon a time there lived a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a  real  princess. He traveled far and wide to find one but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were many princesses, but it was hard to decide how far  real  they were. So he returned home sadly.   One evening a terrible storm rose along with thunder and lightning, and rain poured down heavily. Suddenly a knock was heard at the castle gate. On opening it was found that a princess was standing at the door. But, good gracious! what a sight the whether had done to her.  The water ran down from her hair and clothes; and she was in a very bad condition and  yet she said that she was a real princess ?!, thought the queen.  We ll soon find that out,  thought the old queen. But she said nothing. She went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.   On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.   Oh, very badly!  said she.  I hardly closed my eyes all night. God only knows what was in the bedâ€¦ I was lying on something hard. It was horrible!    Now they knew that she was a  real  princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.   Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.   So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a  real  princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, provided no one has stolen it!", 
 "the frog prince" :
 " One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.  After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry, and said,  Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.   Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,  Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?    Alas!  said she,  what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.   The frog said,  I do not want your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep on your bed, I will bring you your ball again.    What nonsense,  thought the princess,  this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.   So she said to the frog,  Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.   Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring.  As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.  The frog called after her,  Stay, princess, and take me with you as you said,   But she did not stop to hear a word.  The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise - tap, tap - plash, plash - as if something was coming up the marble staircase, and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:   Open the door, my princess dear,  Open the door to thy true love here!  And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.   Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat.  The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter.  There is a nasty frog,  said she,  at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning. I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.   While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:   Open the door, my princess dear,  Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.   Then the king said to the young princess,  As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.  She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on - tap, tap - plash, plash - from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat.   Pray lift me upon chair,  said he to the princess,  and let me sit next to you.   As soon as she had done this, the frog said,  Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.   This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said,  Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.  And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long.  As soon as it was light the frog jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.   Now, then,  thought the princess,  at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.   But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:   Open the door, my princess dear,  Open the door to thy true love here!  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.   And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen and standing at the head of her bed.  He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.   You,  said the prince,  have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my fathers kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.   The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying  Yes  to all this; and as they spoke a brightly coloured coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the princes servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.  They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the princes kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.

"the 3 bears" :
"In a far-off country there was once a little girl who was called Silver-hair, because her curly hair shone brightly. She was a sad romp, and so restless that she could not be kept quiet at home, but must needs run out and away, without leave.   One day she started off into a wood to gather wild flowers, and into the fields to chase butterflies. She ran here and she ran there, and went so far, at last, that she found herself in a lonely place, where she saw a snug little house, in which three bears lived; but they were not then at home.   The door was ajar, and Silver-hair pushed it open and found the place to be quite empty, so she made up her mind to go in boldly, and look all about the place, little thinking what sort of people lived there.   Now the three bears had gone out to walk a little before this. They were the Big Bear, and the Middle-sized Bear, and the Little Bear; but they had left their porridge on the table to cool. So when Silver-hair came into the kitchen, she saw the three bowls of porridge. She tasted the largest bowl, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too cold; then she tasted the middle-sized bowl, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear, and found it too hot; then she tasted the smallest bowl, which belonged to the Little Bear, and it was just right, and she ate it all.   She went into the parlour, and there were three chairs. She tried the biggest chair, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too high; then she tried the middle-sized chair, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear, and she found it too broad; then she tried the little chair, which belonged to the Little Bear, and found it just right, but she sat in it so hard that she broke it.   Now Silver-hair was by this time very tired, and she went upstairs to the chamber, and there she found three beds. She tried the largest bed, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too soft; then she tried the middle-sized bed, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear, and she found it too hard; then she tried the smallest bed, which belonged to the Little Bear, and found it just right, so she lay down upon it, and fell fast asleep.   While Silver-hair was lying fast asleep, the three bears came home from their walk. They came into the kitchen, to get their porridge, but when the Big Bear went to his, he growled out:    SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TASTING MY PORRIDGE!    and the Middle-sized Bear looked into his bowl, and said:    Somebody Has Been Tasting My Porridge!    and the Little Bear piped:    Somebody has tasted my porridge and eaten it all up!    Then they went into the parlour, and the Big Bear growled:    SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!    and the Middle-sized Bear said:    Somebody Has Been Sitting In My Chair!    and the Little Bear piped:    Somebody has been sitting in my chair, and has broken it all to pieces!    So they went upstairs into the chamber, and the Big Bear growled:    SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TUMBLING MY BED!    and the Middle-sized Bear said:    Somebody Has Been Tumbling My Bed!    and the little Bear piped:    Somebody has been tumbling my bed, and here she is!    At that, Silver-hair woke in a fright, and jumped out of the window and ran away as fast as her legs could carry her, and never went near the Three Bears  snug little house again.",
"the dancing monkeys" :
"A prince had monkeys in his court that could dance. As monkeys are natural mimics, they looked wonderful in their rich clothes and masks, dancing very much like human beings. Word spread far and wide about their unique performance and people from all over flocked to see them perform every day. Everyone was amazed at the monkeys   intelligence. One day, a mischievous courtier thought of playing a trick on the monkeys. When the monkeys were dancing, he took a pocketful of nuts and threw them upon the stage.

Everyone started laughing at the entertaining sight. The people realised that even though they looked like humans they actually were animals.",

Soon he fell sleep. When he awoke he was alone. Rip looked for his gun. To his surprise it was covered in rust! Feeling confused and hungry, Rip headed for his village. People gathered around him staring at his tattered clothes and long grey beard. Rip saw a young woman who looked like his wife and asked her who she was.

I am your father, . cried Rip joyfully and told them all how he had been asleep for the last twenty years!", 
"the lion and the frog" :

He also knew every corner of the forest and every animal and every sound in it. Now, there was a pond in the middle of the forest. The Lion would drink water and sleep there for some time, every day. One day, the Lion finished drinking water and lay down by the pond. As his eyes were closing, he heard a new sound. It was a hollow, croaky sound. He opened his eyes, but he didnt see anyone! Then, he heard it a second, and a third time. By now, the Lion was scared and thought in fear,   What if it were a ghost?   After some time, a Frog crawled out of the pond and croaked. The Lion saw that he had been scared out of his wits by so small a creature! He grew angry with the Frog and tore it to pieces with his claws. The poor Frog never croaked again!

Pretending to ask how the Wolf was feeling, the Fox came to the mouth of the cave and peeped in. The Fox thought, he would be invited to share the goodies. But, the Wolf replied in a gruff voice,   I am too sick to see you, my dear friend. . The Fox trotted off, very angry and upset with the Wolf. He went straight to the Shepherd and said,   Get yourself a good stick and come with me, I shall show you where the Wolf lives. . The Shepherd found the Wolf and killed him with the stick.
